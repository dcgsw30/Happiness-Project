# Happiness-Project

I systematically designed a small scale program using Python to analyze average happiness levels across different continents. The program is represented by a single "main" function that takes CSV file data and a list of continents of interest as arguments. A call to that "main" function would produce a bar graph representing the average happiness levels of each continent.

This program may sound rather simple, but the "main" function is supported by quite a lot of helper functions. The helper functions work to:
* Read and filter the CSV file for the appropriate data columns
* Convert the CSV file data into non-primitive or primitive data types 
* Calculate the average happiness scores
* Plot the data onto a bar graph
